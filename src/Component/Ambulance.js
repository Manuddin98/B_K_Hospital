            An ambulance is a vehicle used to transport people who are sick or injured. Most ambulances are either trucks with space for patients or cargo vans with raised roofs. Ambulances usually take patients to a hospital.

Specially trained people called emergency medical technicians, or EMTs, ride in ambulances. They give sick or injured people emergency medical care before they reach the hospital.

Ambulances have many types of equipment that are used to move and to treat patients. Equipment for moving patients includes stretchers and cots with wheels. An ambulance’s medical equipment helps to treat breathing problems, heart attacks, broken bones, and burns right away.

Large cities have hundreds of ambulances. They are owned by public and private hospitals, fire departments, and private emergency medical services.

Some places use airplanes or helicopters as ambulances. These air ambulances have the same equipment as ground ambulances. Air ambulances reach people in out-of-the-way areas. They also transport patients more quickly than ground vehicles.

Most ambulance developments took place during wartime. In the early 1800s the French army used two-wheeled, horse-drawn wagons to bring soldiers to battlefield hospitals. In the 1860s public hospitals began keeping their own horse-drawn ambulances. The first motorized ambulance was built in 1899. Airplanes were used as ambulances for the first time during World War I (1914–18). Helicopters first served as ambulances during the Korean War (1950–53).
